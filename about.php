    <p>Pretty much, I don't have much to say here for now. But I have been through 3 different  free energy designs. I have worked on them off and on for a period of 3 years. I really have a lot of time on my hands. My cousin gave me the idea about free energy. But I came up with my own ideas on how it would work. And probably, there's more ways it could be designed, but maybe I'm wrong. Like for A/C, there's like I think one way it works and that's it. Maybe it's like that with free energy. Maybe somebody out there in the world knows something I don't. I just want to help people get free electricity in the world. There is some people that probably don't have it. Like in 3rd world countries. I know this technology will get rid of pollution and gases in the <em>atmosphere</em> that destroys the ozone layer. But maybe I might change the world. Maybe I might become a trillionaire out of this. But it really don't matter if I don't ! Cause god is great! I'm pretty much a person that likes to live small. Being a big shot ruins your reputation. Big shots are usually snooty and are usually spoiled. They always get what they want. Me, I try to be considerate and humble. But for now, I got to go.</p>
